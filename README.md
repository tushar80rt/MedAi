# 🏥 MedAI Pro – AI-Powered Medical Report Analyzer

🩺 Imagine this...
You're a doctor, student, or just someone trying to understand a lab report.
You open a 50-page PDF filled with blood work, medical terms, and charts.

You have one question:

“Is the patient’s WBC count normal?”

But you're stuck scanning through paragraphs.

What if you could just ask your question… and get the answer in seconds?

🔥 Meet Med-AI
Med-AI is a blazing-fast PDF Q&A assistant for medical documents.

Built with:

💬 LLaMA 4 (Meta’s powerful open LLM)

⚡ Groq API (ultra-low latency inference)

🧠 Camel AI agents (smart prompting strategy)

🖥 Streamlit UI (sleek chat + PDF preview)

Whether you're analyzing reports or learning medicine — Med-AI gives you answers, not headaches.
